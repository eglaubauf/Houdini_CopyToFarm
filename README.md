# Houdini_CopyToFarm

## Development stopped
This plugin will not be developed any further


This script provides a window in which the user is able to select a directory to copy the current file and it´s dependencies to a different, arbitrary location (e.g. a network storage). In this process the script will copy all linked/referenced files to the chosen location as long as they are below the current workspace. 

The addon also provides the user with a list of files which will be copied. The script is optmized for fast copying and copies only the files which are referenced or linked to within Houdini.

The user can also choose if only newer files or all files should be copied. In both cases existing files will be overwritten. The script will automatically open the new file in it´s new location. The old file will be left untouched.

This script has been tested with Houdini 17.5.360 and Windows 10.
